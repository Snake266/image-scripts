My small collection of scripts to work with images in Python.

At this time there are several scripts:

- `apply_medfilt` to apply median filter (scipy.signal.medfilt) on an image
- `image_to_npy` to convert image to binary numpy file
- `npy_to_image` to convert a binary numpy file to an image (png by default)
- `psnr_ssim_calc` to calculate *peak signal noise ratio* and *structural similarity*

## Using

You can use `-h` or `--help` to get help message for each script.
